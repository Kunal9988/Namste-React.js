so this is my notes folder of react 

* NPM stands for just anything else (it is not have full form )

- it is not node package manager 
- it is work as a Node package manager
- * package.json -package.json is configuration for a the NPM , why we need it alot of tie it know as a dependencies


* parcel we use while a ignite our app

- basically its a bundler 
- its combine aur files (.js,.jsx,.css,.html)
-optimizes them into bundle (ready for production)
- outputs them into a bundle 
- runs a dev server with hot reloading (auto update browser when  on file save )

* caret(^) and tilde(~) - difference is   (caret we use )

- if we use tilde (~) some how a new version of a parcel has come then if we use tilde its 
  automatically install new version of a parcel or any other thing pack so , its harm our 
  app bcos we create app in (v1), then its update some dependencies are not their our app 
  gets collaps so instead of tilde we use caret , so which we its update only miner updates
  only so which we can have all dependencies so which we run our app 

* what is difference bitween package.json and package-lock.json

- package.json = package.json has only this dependencies which we use and which we use i
  intially so its consist only a dependencies which we we need intially but a  

- package-lock.json = package-lock.json has a all dependencies which package.json need 
  (their has a hiercial struture in this so dependencies) has or need their own dependencie
  s so ists store in the package-lock.json , and its keep track of all the version of the 
  all of them.
  -- both are imp in it 
  if i have package.json and package-lock.json i can create whole nodemodule file so we can
  put into .gitignore

* node modules -
  node modules are a some files which has a all dependencies or which we need into a prj.
  basically its consist a package
  - its huge 


* transitive dependencies - means a dependencies has their on dependencies
